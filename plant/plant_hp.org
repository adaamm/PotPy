* Defining the Health of a plant
** Goal
How can we know how much health does a plant have ?
** Health (hp)
In gaming, this describes how much life points a character has before dying.
** Conclusion
Maybe we have to rethink the Health bar thing. Since, we cannot actually
determine how much. Maybe we can rephrase to "Happiness Bar".
** Hapiness bar
*** Conditions to be "happy"
- water
- light (ie. uv)
- temperature
- ph
** Plants we can simulate
