#+TITLE: simulation_notes

* Tips
** what we want to simulate is stuff we cannot immediately get results of
*** ie we cant wait to build the building and then test it
*** so for us it is
**** we cannot wait for the moisture to get wet / dry / etc ...
**** we cannot wait for the sun to have lots of light / medium light / no light
**** we cannot wait for the temperature to go up and down
***** we need to simulate these environments
***** what we want to shortcut is time
** How to go about it ?
*** simulate the raspberry pi
*** simulate plant
*** simulate weather conditions
** Raspberry Pi Simulation
*** for our purpose
- read data from sensors
- all the rest that is done on the pi can be done on a regular computer
** Plant Simulation
*** for our purpose
- how fast it can "drain" water
- pretty much it
** Weather Condition Simulation
*** for our purpose
- how much can the sun fluctuate in within how much time
- how much can rain fluctuate in within how much time
- how much can temperater fluctuate in within how much time
