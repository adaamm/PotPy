* Firebase <-> Raspberry Pi
** Goal
- Have the Raspberry Pi be able to have the knowledge of which plant it is monitoring and setting appropriate configs for that plant (for the sensors)
  - as of now, moisture is the only value that we will actually act on
    - by providing water if moisture level are too low
- What should be the data flow look like ?
  - phone <-> firebase <-> pi <-> plant (sensors)
    - get plant
    - add plant to phone -> this will add to firebase + plant type
    - pi detects the plant added - looks at plant type
    - depending on plant type -> uses json database to set the plant needs on
      the pi
    - pi sets the needs of plant according to type of plant
